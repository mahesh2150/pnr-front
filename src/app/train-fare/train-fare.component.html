          <p>Indian railways recently introduced EA class that are Anubhiti Coaches which are attached in some of the shatabdi trains. Ticket fare for this class is highest and generally is 1.2 times the fare of executive class. Indian railways follow different pricing structure for different trains. Indian railway has premium trains which are Rajdhani, shatabdi and duranto. For these trains, it follows dynamic pricing, which means the fare of the ticket increases dynamically as the number of available seats decreases. While, for all the remaining trains like superfast, expresses, double decker and passengers the train fares are remaining same for all the time irrespective of seats available.</p>
          <p>Following is the order of the classes based on the ticket fares.</p>
